Minimal Todo App with gRPC and Docker

A simple, minimalistic todo application that utilizes gRPC for backend communication and Docker for containerization. The frontend is a clean, Apple-like UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, served via an Express.js server.

Run the Code:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
docker-compose up --build
